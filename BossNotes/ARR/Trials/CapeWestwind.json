He has two shields, one on each of his arm.\r\n\r\nThroughout the fight, Rihtahtyn will spawn flaming circles on the ground. Players standing in the circles will take damage over time. Avoid these circles if possible. He will charge up magitek missiles. Players can avoid these missiles by moving away from where the boss is standing.\r\n\r\nAt around 2/3 HP, he will spawn 2 adds at the doorway. One of the tanks should take the aggro of these adds.",
