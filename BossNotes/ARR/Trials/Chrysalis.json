If you alternate between the big and small orbs (big gives physical vulnerability, small gives magical vulnerability) then you won't take much damage. For each orb that hits him he will gain a stack. Small adds do not have much hp and perform a cone AoE. Stack up for heals and Sacred Soil if you have 3+ stacks. 7 stacks is instant death for non tanks.",

He will also randomly cast Quake 3, which does AoE damage to party for about 2500 damage on non tanks.\r\n\r\nAt 20%, he will perform Meteor:\r\n\r\nFloor will turn red and give you a bleed. You can run to the edge and keep running while you are sucked in, after the bleed hits 0 you are instantly sucked in. After you are sucked in, you are sent to a new room. Any buffs/debuffs that were affecting you before you were sucked into the vortex will have their duration multiplied by 10. To make the next segment easier, all DPS should use all damage buffs and Tanks should use Hp and Defense buffs.\r\n\r\nMeteors fall continuously. If a meteor doesn't land on a player, it deals damage to the entire party, so one player should tank each meteor.\r\n\r\nOnly tanks (and optionally one healer) should try to get hit by meteors. Only one player needs to be in any particular meteor's landing circle.\r\n\r\nHealers may wish to both run to one each time to split the damage. If your tanks applied proper buffs, they should lose less than half their health each meteor.\r\n\r\nAfter the first meteor falls, a tear will appear on its location that you must kill to end the phase. DPS should immediately focus this tear, using a Limit Break if needed. There is a visual tell in the middle of the room, an extremely large meteor that slowly falls and will wipe the party if it manages to hit the ground before the tear is destroyed. Meteors will continue to fall and tanks and healers should continue to run to the next empty meteor zone.",
