            InDepthStrategy = @"Amon should be tanked in the center of the opera house. He has 3 main spells, Blizzard Forte is an AoE centered on Amon and does large damage plus heavy, Thunder Forte is cast on a patch of ground under random players, and can overlap for massive damage and leaves an electrocution DoT if hit, Firaga Forte is a raid wide blast, but not as damaging as the other two.

His Cleave is called Coloatura and is extremely damaging, no one but the tank should ever be in front of him.

Adds will spawn from the corners and march toward Amon (named Experiment #33, Experiment #66, Experiment #99, and so on). If they reach Amon they will cast raid wide debuffs on the party, either Pacification or Silence. Best way to kill them is to stun them and just burn them down.

He will also spawn purple orb which will tether to a player and cast mini on them if it hits, at this time strong adds called Kum Kum's will spawn which should be grabbed by the off tanks, they can be shrunk by the orbs making them much easier to kill. If not successful at shrinking anyone the orbs will eventually fade on their own.

He also has an attack which adds a bomb debuff to a player, that player will detonate repeatedly for small damage plus knock back. This can be Esuna/Leeched and should be asap as the knock back range is pretty high.

Occasionally, he will freeze 3 random players, one from each group and one person from each group will also be turned into a flame toad a la Gilgamesh and have no command available except Flame Breath. Flame Breath can be used to unfreeze people encased in blocks of ice.

Kichinebik's will spawn at the same time that flame toad debuff occurs. These will each pick a toad target and chase them the DPS needs quickly kill them. If they reach a toad, they will aggro them and deal heavy damage (3-4k-ish) per autoattack, even if the players change back, the snakes will still attack them for huge damage if not killed. Remember the green chickens on Gilgamesh? Yep, same thing here.

Eventually, Amon will encase three people at random in blocks of ice and he will begin to cast Curtain Call.

Hide behind the frozen people when he uses Curtain Call (similar mechanic to Meteor in King Behemoth). Like King Behemoth if the ice block is too close to Amon it will not protect the people hiding who will be killed anyway, so try to hide behind blocks away from his body.";
