A horde of zombies will be summoned and start chasing one of the players other than the tank. DO NOT ATTACK THEM, kite them. At some point, she will put an orange/red arrow-like mark over someone's head (again, not the tank). That person needs to run into the horde. This unleashes an AoE that will kill the zombies for you. If you kill a zombie yourself, the party takes a huge damage resistance debuff that lasts one minute and stacks up to 8 times. If you don't make the boss kill the zombies with her AoE on the first two attempts, you will take the debuff from the remaining zombies a few seconds later after she does her next attack. Go all out on damage during the breaks between hordes.\r\n\r\nDo not attack the adds. The person with the red arrow mark should go to the person being attacked by the adds.\r\nPlayers should group up in the middle so the player targeted by the adds will always be next to the player marked by the arrow",

The key is to stop the NPC in the middle from taking any damage. Any time he takes damage the boss will grow bigger and stronger. If he dies, the boss does a full party wipe attack. At various points during the fight purple balls of energy will come out of the portals and head towards the NPC. You need to have everyone run through them to prematurely detonate them to protect the NPC. Later, there will be two larger balls instead of the bunch of smaller ones. They seem to move slow enough so just knock them out. The boss also has an AoE attack that will leave a danger zone on the floor that causes bleeding type DoT. I was able to keep it on the edge of the map but really be careful not to let the NPC get hit by it.\r\n\r\nIntercept the orbs spawned by the portals at the edge of the boss room.

If any of them reach the circle, a rune on the floor will light up. The more runes light up, the stronger the boss's \"Red Wedding\" attack will hit at the end of this.\r\n\r\nDo not let crawling zombie adds reach the center of the room.
