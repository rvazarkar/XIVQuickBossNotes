Whenever Hecatoncheir uses Darkfire, a Flamebeau (bomb type monster) spawns. The Flamebeau will attempt to move towards the fire. Kill the Flamebeau ASAP.

      "InDepthStrategy":"Gogmagolem is a spriggan operating a rock giant. The boss not only has very high defense, it will also move back and forth in the boss room.\r\n\r\nIn the boss room, there is an object named Improved Blasting Device. One of your party members should operate the Device to spawn a Waymaker Bomb. That player should pick up the bomb. When it says it is going to explode in 5 seconds, place it in the path of the Gogmagolem. This is the main method of damaging the boss. Black bombs will also spawn near the Blasting Device and the center of the room. These will Self-Destruct, so move away quickly.\r\n\r\nThe other DPS should focus on killing all of the Kindling Sprites that spawn around the edges of the room.\r\n\r\nWhen the Golem dies, the spriggan named Biggy will spawn. Kill Biggy and move away from very large bombs because these bombs will explode in a very large radius.\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n\r\nOne DPS should spawn bombs with Improved Blasting Device, then carry and drop bombs in path of Gomagolem\r\nOther DPS focus adds\r\nWhen Biggy spawns, DPS him down",

Players should move away from the rock to avoid taking damage from the Sand Worm. If the rock is not placed in time, the Sand Worm will cast Bottomless Desert and pull all players to the middle of the room and deal heavy damage to all players. Bottomless Desert can easily lead to a wipe, so make sure someone is on dedicated rock duty.\r\nTL;DR:\r\n\r\nBurn down boss\r\nWhen Sand Worm is Searching for Fodder, carry Crystallized Rock onto the sand and drop it to distract the worm",
