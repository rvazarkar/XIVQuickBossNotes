The tank should shift from the north position into a north-west position, while the ranged classes all stack on the wall directly to the West. You should end up in this arrangement. This will allow the Great Whirlwinds to appear harmlessly around everyone, as well as create a section for the adds to be tanked in.

After a short time, Garuda will vanish and re-spawns at the south part of the room along with 2 adds, Suparna and Chirada. These adds have similar abilities as Garuda. Tanks should tank these adds away from rest of the party to avoid Slipstream hitting everyone. One of the adds will have a green beam linked to Garuda while the other add will have a red beam linked to Garuda. Players must kill the add with the green beam ASAP because the add will heal Garuda when it's alive. Players should use cooldowns if necessary. Afterwards players should kill the add with red beam. The off-tank should grab the add with the red beam and tank it facing away from the group at this position. The main tank can also pick this add up if you're only running with one tank. This will be the heaviest damage during the encounter. One healer should focus on keeping the main tank alive through Garuda's increased damage while the other focuses on the large amount of AoE healing needed from Friction and Wicked Wheel hitting so many players.

Once both adds are brought down, the tornadoes will start to fade. As soon as the northern whirlwind fades, the tank needs to run along the wall to the north-east side of the room. The whirlwinds will start to rotate, forcing the group to move clockwise around the room. During this time, a group of Razor Plumes and a single Satin Plume will spawn. DPS should kill the Satin Plume as quickly as possible to avoid the sleep debuff. The Razor Plumes are easy to heal through, so ignore them in favor of more DPS on Garuda. Once you reach the East side of the room, the whirlwinds will fade completely and everyone should move to the middle of the room to prepare for Eye of the Storm.

While in the middle of the room, Garuda will vanish again, reappearing in the South with Suparna and Chirada spawning on the East and West sides of the room. Each of these adds should be tanked on the edge they come in at, with the main tank on Garuda (south), the off-tank on the add with a red beam (east or west) and all the DPS on the green beam add (East or West). This leaves the healers either in the middle or on the North edge, free to heal up everyone.

Once the adds have been finished off and Eye of the Storm fades, all the ranged players should move directly South, with the tank should move to the south-west position. More tornadoes will spawn, which will start to rotate as more plumes spawn. Once again focus the Satin Plume down and ignore the rest. You will rotate around the room until you're roughly in the same position you started Phase 2 at. She will vanish, spawning one last set of adds. Use Meteor, the level 3 limit break, to nearly kill both of them instantly and finish off Garuda. If she is not almost dead at this point, either DPS is too low overall or the add with the green beam has not been killed quickly enough each time and healed Garuda too much.";
