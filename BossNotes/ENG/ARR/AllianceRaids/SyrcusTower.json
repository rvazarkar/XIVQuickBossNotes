      "InDepthStrategy":"Elemental balls - Random DPS and healers will be marked to be followed by balls of elemental energy. Lightning balls appear purple, ice balls appear blue, and flame balls appear red. You will have to deal with this mechanic throughout the fight.\r\n\r\nLightning ball - Neutralized by the lightning pillar. Running them into the lightning pillar energizes the pillar, which is denoted by panels of light on the ground next to the pillar. Three charges are needed and will produce a red marker indicating that the pillar is fully charged. Lightning balls detonate for heavy raid wide damage after about 15 seconds if not run into a pillar.\r\n\r\nIce ball - Trails a target and will freeze that target after a set duration of time. This is unavoidable and cannot be stopped. What you can and should do is make sure that you are not standing in one of the puddles left behind when a frozen target is thawed, as everyone in the vicinity of the puddle will be frozen as well, an important consideration for melee. Thaws after 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nFlame ball - will chase a target and detonate after about 15 seconds. Can be used to thaw frozen targets, and you should. Thawing a frozen target leaves behind a patch of water on the ground which confers very high fire resistance, but will spread the freeze effect of an ice ball if it detonates inside the puddle.",

      "InDepthStrategy":"Amon should be tanked in the center of the opera house. He has 3 main spells, Blizzard Forte is an AoE centered on Amon and does large damage plus heavy, Thunder Forte is cast on a patch of ground under random players, and can overlap for massive damage and leaves an electrocution DoT if hit, Firaga Forte is a raid wide blast, but not as damaging as the other two.\r\n\r\nHis Cleave is called Coloatura and is extremely damaging, no one but the tank should ever be in front of him.\r\n\r\nAdds will spawn from the corners and march toward Amon (named Experiment #33, Experiment #66, Experiment #99, and so on). If they reach Amon they will cast raid wide debuffs on the party, either Pacification or Silence. Best way to kill them is to stun them and just burn them down.\r\n\r\nHe will also spawn purple orb which will tether to a player and cast mini on them if it hits, at this time strong adds called Kum Kum's will spawn which should be grabbed by the off tanks, they can be shrunk by the orbs making them much easier to kill. If not successful at shrinking anyone the orbs will eventually fade on their own.\r\n\r\nHe also has an attack which adds a bomb debuff to a player, that player will detonate repeatedly for small damage plus knock back. This can be Esuna/Leeched and should be asap as the knock back range is pretty high.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, he will freeze 3 random players, one from each group and one person from each group will also be turned into a flame toad a la Gilgamesh and have no command available except Flame Breath. Flame Breath can be used to unfreeze people encased in blocks of ice.\r\n\r\nKichinebik's will spawn at the same time that flame toad debuff occurs. These will each pick a toad target and chase them the DPS needs quickly kill them. If they reach a toad, they will aggro them and deal heavy damage (3-4k-ish) per autoattack, even if the players change back, the snakes will still attack them for huge damage if not killed. Remember the green chickens on Gilgamesh? Yep, same thing here.\r\n\r\nEventually, Amon will encase three people at random in blocks of ice and he will begin to cast Curtain Call.\r\n\r\nHide behind the frozen people when he uses Curtain Call (similar mechanic to Meteor in King Behemoth). Like King Behemoth if the ice block is too close to Amon it will not protect the people hiding who will be killed anyway, so try to hide behind blocks away from his body.",

      "Name":"Xande",
      "InDepthStrategy":"Xande should be tanked in the center of the arena. He has the standard \"don't stand in this\" mechanics, including a targeted AoE which deals about 2k damage. While not dangerous, a DPS can potentially be one-shotted if two are overlapping each other and the DPS is still standing in them. He also has The People's Elbow, which is centered on him, and deals moderate damage with a severe knockback. Melee must watch out for this.\r\n\r\nAetherochemical Explosion - Every now and then Xande creates golden orbs with a small golden radius around them. You have about 10-15 seconds before they detonate, so the raid should be fairly well spread in anticipation of this. They explode and deal about 500 damage per explosion if not neutralized, and since he spawns about a dozen at a time, this is a good way to lose a chunk of your raid if nobody is paying attention. To stop the explosion, simply have a person stand within the golden radius. This causes the orb to hit that person for about 50 damage upon detonation, rather than blasting the entire raid for ten times that damage.\r\n\r\nAt 70%, Xande teleports out of the arena and lounges on his throne while calling down meteors on your raid Sephiroth-style. This is the first intermission. 3 Attractors will appear on the edge of the arena. They must be killed quickly to prevent meteorfall. Additionally a giant attractor appears in the center. The entire raid should this one together once the three attractors on the fringes have been destroyed. If the small meteors land they cause heavy raid wide damage, if the big one lands it is a wipe. In short, handle this mechanic like the trash in Labyrinth leading up to King Behemoth.\r\n\r\nOnce Xande reappears, phase 2 begins. He now has a new ability where one person from each group gains an ominous black aura around them. This thing expires after about 15 seconds and deals close to 10k damage, split evenly amongst everyone standing in it, so each group should stack up close to Xande but without overlapping to soak. A null gravity zone is left behind upon detonation which lets you float. This is important because ...\r\n\r\nImmediately after detonation, Xande will cast Ancient Quaga. The ability deals more than 5k damage to everyone in the raid. Ancient Quaga is nullified by floating. When Xande casts Ancient Quaga, everyone should move into a null gravity zone.\r\n\r\nXande retains golden orbs in this phase.",
