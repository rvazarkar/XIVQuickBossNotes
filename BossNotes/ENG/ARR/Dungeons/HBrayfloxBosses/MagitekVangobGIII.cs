                @"Throughout the fight ceruleum spills from the boss, creating vivid blue circles of liquid that start to cover larger and larger chunks of the arena. After several pools of ceruleum have spilled, the boss sets off a bomb of some kind that will explode and cause all of the ceruleum to ignite as well, doing a large chunk of damage to anyone still inside the blue zones when it goes off. Getting out of the blue areas all depends on your tank's ability to kite the boss (similar to Aiatar) and your own positioning around the walls to keep the ceruleum from covering too much ground. From time to time, the boss will call out two Illuminati adds that must be DPS'd down in quick fashion. After a set amount of time, the boss will use a Halicarnassus-like aerial attack that does damage based on the health of the adds. They were always dead by the time the attack happened for my group, so the damage was pretty minimal (maybe 500 HP?) but I would imagine that it gets much worse if an add is still alive.";
