      "InDepthStrategy": "Odious Air: A cone that deals damage and inflicts Poison.\r\nVine Whip: Tankbuster.\r\nFault Warren: Stack marker on a random player.\r\nEvery so often, a non-targetable Rafflesia add will spawn on the edge of the arena with a notification of \"The hall echoes with the twitching of roots and vines\". It will target two random players with markers that create poisonous pools that inflict Leaden while the players stand in them.\r\nDevour: The Nullchu will leap to the Rafflesia\u0027s position and consume it. It will then turn towards the center of the arena and breathe poison, which deals damage every second a player stands in it and also inflicts Poison. The best way to avoid this is to stand near the Rafflesia, as the poison breath casts extremely quickly. Nullchu telegraphs this attack by turning to face the Rafflesia, with a notification of \"The Nullchu has found its next meal!\"\r\nTaproot: All players are targeted with AoEs, spread out to avoid overlapping damage.",

      "InDepthStrategy": "When the fight begins, the edges of the arena will be coated in thorny vines, damaging players who come in contact with them as well as inflicting a stack of Vulnerability Up.\r\n\r\nStone II: Tankbuster.\r\nTectonics: Party-wide damage.\r\nLandslip: The arena is covered in four \"conveyor belt\" line markers, and a few Silt Golem adds will spawn on the outside of the arena. When the cast completes, all players will be pushed in the direction of the arrows a distance roughly equivalent to half the arena. As players are being pushed, the Silt Golems will cast Rockslide, damaging in a line ahead of them and inflicting Vulnerability Up.\r\nPlayers should do their best to be pushed into a safe area, as there\u0027s little time to avoid Rockslide after being pushed.\r\nEarthquake: Melee-range area of effect followed immediately by a ring area of effect. Move to melee range or far range to dodge.\r\nEarth Shaker: Marks the two DPS players, dealing damage in a line from the boss to the player.\r\nEmpty Gaze: Gaze attack that inflicts Hysteria.",
      "QuickStrategy": "Avoid the edges of the arena.\r\nTry to end up in safe areas after conveyor belts. Earthquake hits close and then far. Avoid \"Empty Gaze\" by turning away from boss."

      "Name": "Tokkapchi",
      "InDepthStrategy": "The arena for this fight is a grate with four solid platforms. Periodically, the mud beneath the platform will churn with the message \"The puddles begin to froth\". After a short delay, mud will explode upwards through the grate, damaging players not on a solid platform and launching them into the air.\r\n\r\nMudsling: Tankbuster.\r\nQuagmire: All players are marked for an AoE. Spread out to avoid overlap, but also keep the center of the attack off the solid platforms. Allowing Quagmire to coat a platform creates a highly-damaging puddle on that platform.\r\nMud Pie: Tokkapchi will move to the center of the arena and create a Mud Slime add. The add cannot be killed, only pushed via damage. Keep all of the boss\u0027s area of effect attacks away from the Mud Slime, including the periodic puddle explosion. Allowing the Mud Slime to be hit with attacks will cause it to grow, causing it to deal more damage when it finally detonates.\r\nAfter roughly 45 seconds, the Mud Slime will cast Corrupture, dealing damage to the entire party based on how large it became. If the Mud Slime was not allowed to grow at all, Corrupture instead only hits melee range. If the Mud Slime grows once, Corrupture will deal moderate party-wide damage. If the Mud Slime grows twice, it will explode immediately for very high damage while also inflicting Damage Down.\r\nRoyal Flush: Melee-range area of effect.\r\nDuring the second cast of Mud Pie, two Muddy Dorpokkur adds will spawn. These adds have low HP and mainly serve as a distraction from the newly-created Mud Slime.\r\nFeculent Flood: Cone attack targeting the Mud Slime. Very long cast time to allow the players to push the Mud Slime away.\r\nBog Bequest: Ring area of effect that leaves melee range safe. If Tokkapchi is on the edge of the arena, the opposite side is also a safe area.",
      "QuickStrategy": "Spread out for \"Quagmire\" as it will leave a puddle when it expires.\r\nDon\u0027t allow the add to get by by any AoE. Attacks will push the add away."
