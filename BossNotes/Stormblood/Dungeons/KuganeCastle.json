When a bomb is killed, it will stay in place and damage anyone in its radius AoE. Players who get tethered should keep to one side of the room to make it easier to avoid the very large AoE.\r\n\r\nHealers should prepare to heal through his occasional casts of Kenki Release, which hits the whole party.",

Interact with as much gold as you can to pick it up; his dog prioritizes gold in the order in which it drops. When the Payday phase completes, Yojimbo will deal groupwide damage according to how much the duty gauge has filled.\r\n\r\nBe ready for occasional groupwide damage from Metta-Giri.\r\n\r\nInoshi-Katcho casts circle AoEs on first the center of the room, then the outskirts. Move out of these.\r\n\r\nAvoid his circle AoE he casts on himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the second Payday phase, act as before, but destroy the dragon heads he summons during this phase. They cast column AoEs on players\u0027 locations, and don\u0027t take much punishment before dying. He may summon dragon heads after the second Payday phase is complete as well; deal with them when that time comes.",
